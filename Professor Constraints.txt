Grove (2/2022)
- prefers 8:00 - she is happy for me to assign her to 8:00 slots every day

Bray (2/2020)
- prefers no 8:00 (kid drop offs). TR could possibly work but not MWF for sure.
- W lab not good based on husband travel schedule. Likes M or T labs.

Wilson L (2/2020)
- very limited availability for afternoon classes based on doctor appointments
- (2/2023) try not to modify her schedule bc of various medical appointments

Rand (9/2020)
- as of Fall 2020, has had conflicts in past based on commuting from San Marcos and school drop offs I think. Not commuting (because of SYN I think), so there are not conflicts this year
- as of Spring 2021, prefers no 8 am due to parenting responsibilities - could make 1 work if needed not 2
